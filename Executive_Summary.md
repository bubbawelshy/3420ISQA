The system that is layed out in the included data flow diagram is very import for every company that uses open source software to implement. It allows managers and developers to be on the same page when it comes to vulnerabilities and licenses for any software package that they are going to use. Also, because it allows managers to see the licenses and vulnerabilities it gives them the oppurtunity to make decisions in regards to the organizations policies about the use of specific software packages.

There are 5 main processes in this system. 1) Developers can submit a new Software Package to be searched for any licenses and vulnerabilities that may be associated with it. 2) Managers can search for existing Software Packages to see its licenses and vulnerabilities. 3) Developers can also search for existing Software Packages to see its licenses and vulnerabilities. 4) Managers can request to view existing policies in regards to specific Software Packages. 5) Managers can update existing policies or create new policies in regards to specific Software Packages.
